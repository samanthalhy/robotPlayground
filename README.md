# Robot Playground
It is a simple online web-based simulation platform for learning basic control of robotics. It mainly uses Javascript for the interaction, control, and render of motions.
There are two types of simulation: 
1. Simple Robot: This simulator provides a real time visualization of the motion/ behavior of the robot based on the user's input. Users can edit the equation and run the code in a browser. 
2. Robot Arm: This simulator provides a real time visualization of the motion of various degree-of-freedom's robot arm. Users can adjust the number of degree-of-freedom(DOF), the angle of each joint, and the scale of the visualization by using sliders.

## How to use
1. Access the webpage https://samanthalhy.github.io/robotPlayground/ with a browser.
2. To see the simulation of the Simple Robot, copy the sample code and paste it to the editor. 
3. Click "Run".
4. That's it! Enjoy~
